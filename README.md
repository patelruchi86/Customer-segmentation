# Customer-segmentation

Marketing strategies are only effective if targeted on right consumers, Therefore Bank wants to group their costumers so that they can build offers and promotions based on types of customers they have. They want to offer products to customers which will be liked by them and will be willing to buy those offers.
So, we are going to make a clustering method which can group the costumers based on their credit card transaction, on base of that Banks can build their strategies.
